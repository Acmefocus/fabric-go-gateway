# Hyperledger Fabric Gateway SDK for Golang

The Fabric Gateway SDK allows applications to interact with a Fabric blockchain network. It provides a simple API to submit transactions to a ledger or query the contents of a ledger with minimal code.

The Gateway SDK implements the Fabric programming model as described in the [Developing Applications](./docs/doc.md) chapter of the Fabric documentation.
